            <p>An Aspiring Web Developer!</p>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated student currently enrolled in the People Information Technology Program
                (PITP), specializing in Web Development. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my progress, 
                demonstrating the skills and projects I have undertaken throughout the course. My goal is 
                to build robust, responsive, and user-friendly web applications, and I am excited to share 
                my learning journey with you. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply 
                my developing expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                My initial focus has been on mastering the fundamentals of HTML structure and semantics, 
                ensuring every project is built on a solid foundation of accessibility and best practices. 
                Future modules will expand into modern CSS layouts, framework mastery, and advanced JavaScript concepts.
